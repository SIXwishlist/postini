h1. postini Gem
h2. Part of the postini4r project

The postini4r project is a collection of sub-projects that aim to implement a broad range of Postini-related tools.

h2. What

The postini gem is a Ruby wrapper library for the "Postini":http://www.postini.com/ SOAP API (Early Access Program).

The postini gem aims to be fully compliant with the Postini API, starting off with what I need first, and then expanding to eventually cover all the available commands in the Batch Command Reference.

h2. Requirements

* The postini gem requires that you gain access to the Postini Early Access Program and an API key. You need to contact your Postini Service Provider (or Postini directly if you deal with them).
* soap4r
